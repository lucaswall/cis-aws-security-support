# Security Support Stack

A simple AWS CDK script to deploy resources that resolve some CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark findings

While following repetitive directions to solve several security findings of the AWS Security Hub I ended
up wiriting this simple stack to be able to deploy the same resources on several accounts.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
